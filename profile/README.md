# CU Anschutz BDC Github account

Hi :wave: thanks for visiting the BDC github account. This account is used by members of the Barbara Davis Diabetes Center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. This repository contains code associated with the papers published by faculy at the BDC. We also have general resources, like pipelines, tutorials, and packages that can be used by the greater community. All of the resources are under active development.
